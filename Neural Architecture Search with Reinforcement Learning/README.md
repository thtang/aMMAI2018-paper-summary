### Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01578.pdf)
*Barret Zoph, Quoc V. Le, ICLR 2017*

## Goal
Design the neural networks architecture automatically.

## Background
1. Neural networks are hard to design. Beside, hyperparameter optimization is an important research topic in machine learning.
2. Previous works search models from a fixed-length space. Thus, those methods often work better with good initial model.
3. Some the other search-based methods are slow and require many heuristics to work well.
