### A Hybrid Neural Network-Latent Topic Model[[1]](https://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/wan-zhu-fergus12.pdf)<br>
*Li Wan et al. JMLR 2012*

## Background
Probabilistic graphical models and neural networks are the two prevalent types of belief network in machine learning.
1. For probabilistic graphical models, explicit variables are linked in a sparse dependency structure and could be specified using domain knowledge.
2. Neural Network, on the other hand, learns implicit meaning and are densely connected.

## Contribution
1. This paper proposes a model that combines a deep neural nework (two layers in fact) with a lantent topic model (LDA).
2. Propose a novel way of transforming the graphical model so that the whole network could be trained jointly.
3. Demonstrate the model on computer vision setting, scene classification.
