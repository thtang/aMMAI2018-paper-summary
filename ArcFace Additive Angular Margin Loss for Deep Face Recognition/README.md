### ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition[[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07698.pdf)
*Jiankang Deng, Jia Guo, Stefanos Zafeiriou, arXiv 2018*

## Goal
Propose a new face recognition model beyond cutting-edge performance.
## Background
* To enhance the discriminative power of the Softmax loss, multiplicative angular margin [2] and additive
cosine margin [3] incorporate angular margin and
cosine margin into the loss functions, respectively.
* Three attributes differ DNN face recognition methods: (1) Training dataset (2) Network architecture (3)Loss functions.
* **Data**, **network** and **loss**, have a high-to-low influenceon the performance of face recognition models.
