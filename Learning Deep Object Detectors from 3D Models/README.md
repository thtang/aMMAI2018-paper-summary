### Learning Deep Object Detectors from 3D Models[[1]](http://www.karimali.org/publications/PSAS_ICCV15.pdf)<br>
*Peng et al. ICCV 2016*
## Goal
Gain more insights about the 3D synthetic data for augmentation and use DCNN for training.
## Novelties
1. Demonstrate experiments to analyse the nature of the invariances.
2. Train a classifier on PASCAL using DCNN.

The idea could be summzrized as following figure:

## Contribution
1. To analyze how missing low-level cues of synthetic data affects object detection performance.
2. Shows the improved performance by using DCNN on PASCAL VOC2007 dataset.
3. Present the largest-scale evaluation of synthetic CAD training of object detectors to date.
